# JavaScript Calculator
Created a calculator using Javascript

Built an app that is functionally similar to the standard machinery.

- It can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- It can clear the input field with a clear button.
- It can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
